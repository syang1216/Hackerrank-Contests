The codes I wrote for the hackerrank contests that I participated in
A lot of these code not particularly optimized for readability but for in 
my opinion runtime, therefore they might not be particularly best practices
in coding that I would write anywhere else. I believe these codes are merely
demonstrations of my problem solving skills. Link for each problem is added
at the top of each file as comment, as well as any significant comments 
about each problem.
